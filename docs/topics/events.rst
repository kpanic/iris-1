Events
======

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Lymph uses events to communicate between various services. For this, `RabbitMQ`_
is currently used to do the event passing. Services can emit events and
subscribe to the queue to consume events. 

The way events are communicated is pluggable and can be easily exchanged at will.
The unittests for instance are using a local event system ``LocalEventSystem`` to
not rely on `RabbitMQ`_.

Other event brokers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lymph allows other event brokers to be easily incorporated. Lymph also 
provides the following additional event broker services:

- Null (a black hole)
- Local (simple event broker that runs in the scope of the main lymph process)
- Kombu (interfaces to `RabbitMQ`_ as a broker using the `kombu`_ library)
- Kafka (interfaces to Apache `Kafka`_, experimental)

The event broker service can be set in the :file:`.lymph.yml` configuration file:

.. code:: yaml

    event_system:
        class: lymph.events.kombu:KombuEventSystem
        transport: amqp
        hostname: 127.0.0.1

See :ref:`event-config` for details.


Subscribing to events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to have methods executed whenever a given event is emitted, you decorate
the function with the ``event`` decorator.

.. decorator:: event(*event_types, sequential=False)

    :param event_types: may contain wildcards (``#`` matching zero or more words and 
                        ``*`` matches one word), e.g. ``'subject.*'``
    :param sequential: force sequential event consumption

    Marks the decorated interface method as an event handler.
    The service container will automatically subscribe to given ``event_types``.
    If ``sequential=True``, events will be not be consumed in parallel by a service instance,
    but one by one.
    
    .. code::
    
        import lymph
        
        class Example(lymph.Interface):
            @lymph.event('task_done')
            def on_task_done(self, event):
                assert isinstance(event, lymph.core.events.Event)

By setting the event decorator, a new queue will be created for this event and given service. Each
time the service receives an event with the specified name, the method is executed. If multiple events
are received, they are processed in parallel.

If you set ``sequential`` to true, the events an instance receives are processed sequentially in the 
given instance. Multiple services however can process the same event in parallel. 

Note that the same events can be processed by different services at various points in time and that there
is no synchronization mechanism to process a given event simultaneously on a global scale.

The method that is decorated with the event decorator needs to follow the following interface:

.. method:: ON_EVENT_METHOD(event)

	:param event: an event object :class:`lymph.core.events.Event`


Dynamically subscribing to events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subscribing to events using the ``event`` decorator only works at service instantiation time.
If you need to subscribe to events at runtime, you need to use the ``subscribe`` decorator:

.. decorator:: subscribe(*event_types, sequential=True)

    Behaves like :func:`lymph.event`, but can be used at runtime
    
    .. code::
    
        class Example(lymph.Service):
            def on_start(self):
                @self.subscribe('dynamic_event_type')
                def on_event(event):
                    assert isinstance(event, lymph.core.events.Event)


Emitting events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``lymph.Interface`` provides a method for emitting events. Therefore any class inheriting from
it can use

.. method:: lymph.Interface.emit(self, event_type, payload)
    :noindex:

    :param event_type: name of the event
    :param payload: a dict of JSON serializable data structures


to emit an event with a specific payload. You need to make sure, that your payload is actually serializable
to JSON by the ``json`` module. Since certain data types need special treatment, lymph provides an extended
JSON serialization facility, which is described in `serialization`_.

A simple example of a class emitting a signal with a simple event would be:

.. code:: 

	class SomeClass(lymph.Interface):
		def emit_event(self):
			self.emit('simple_event', {'article': 'foo', 'quantity': 5})

.. _lymph-emit-and-subscribe-reference:

Command line interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To interact with the event system from the command line, the following
commands are available:

.. code:: bash

	$ lymph subscribe

and

.. code:: bash

	$ lymph emit

lymph subscribe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this command, you can register to a specific event and have all events
printed out on stdout.

For the default example services, this might be:

.. code:: bash

	$ lymph subscribe uppercase_transform_finished
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_282'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_283'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_284'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_285'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_286'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_287'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_288'}
	â€¦

This lists all the events sent to ``uppercase_transform_finished`` produced by
the demo loop which calls the echo service. Each line represents an individual
event, stating its name and its payload.

You can also subscribe to multiple events at once:

.. code:: bash

	$ lymph subscribe event_a event_b
	event_a: {u'data': u'nice'}
	event_b: {u'information': u'data'}


lymph emit
^^^^^^^^^^

With this command, you can manually emit a specific event from the command line.
You need to specify the name of the event and add its payload as a JSON.

For the default example services, this might be:

.. code:: bash

	$ lymph emit uppercase_transform_finished '{"text": "bar_foo_234"}'

This would emit an event with the name ``uppercase_transform_finished`` with the given
payload to any service that is listening to this event. We can inspect the events
sent through the system with the `lymph subscribe`_ command in another terminal instance:

.. code:: bash

	$ lymph subscribe uppercase_transform_finished
	...
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_2629'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_2630'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {u'text': u'bar_foo_234'}
	uppercase_transform_finished: {'text': u'foo_2631'}
	...

We can see that the event has been routed through the event broker along with all the
other events from the demo loop.

Implementation Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Serialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data-payload needs to be serialized in order to be transmitted through events.
Lymph provides two different serialization methods when using `RabbitMQ`_:

- JSON
- MessagePack

Since Lymph also supports other types of events that don't necessarily make use of
`RabbitMQ`_, serialization can differ for different types of events.

.. _rabbitmq: www.rabbitmq.com
.. _kombu: kombu.readthedocs.org/
.. _kafka: kafka.apache.org/
